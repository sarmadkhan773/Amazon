## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or if you are using Yarn then:

```bash
yarn 
```

Installs all required dependencies.

```bash
npm run dev
```

yarn

```bash
yarn 
```

Starts the development server, usually at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## ⚠️ Important

Before pushing code to GitHub, always run:

```bash
npm run build
```

yarn

```bash
yarn run build
```

or simply

```bash
npm build
```

yarn

```bash
yarn build
```

This ensures the build process completes without errors, which may not always appear in the console during development. This is especially important when working with CI/CD pipelines.
